## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<img src="./img/Full-Stack Developer.png">
<p>I'm a Full-Stack Developer specialising in JavaScript, REACT, PHP (OOP), SQL, and Tailwind. Over the coming weeks, I will be working with Jest, Node, Express, MongoDB, Slim, Typescript, and RESTful APIs.

I am currently enrolled on iO Academyâ€™s Full-Stack Track, working on both individual and team projects while applying agile methodologies. As part of a scrum team, I actively participate in sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives. We regularly practice peer programming and use Git for version control. My current interests include PHP OOP and REACT.

You can check out my work live on my portfolio or here on my pinned repositories, where you will find some of my favourite projects including Whack-a-Mole, Tip-Splitter and a backend IT bug tracker.

Before transitioning into software development, I spent ten years in the Maritime Industry working on superyachts where I progressed from Junior Deckhand to Chief Officer. Along the way, I gained multiple qualifications and developed key skills in leadership, teamwork, discipline and problem-solving, qualities that now shape my approach to collaborating in agile environments and continuous learning.</p>
