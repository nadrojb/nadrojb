## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<img src="./img/Full-Stack Developer.png">
<p>I'm a Full-Stack Developer specialising in JavaScript, React, Node.js (Express), PHP (Slim), MySQL, MongoDB, Tailwind, Git for version control and building RESTful APIs. 

I'm currently working on projects with React, TypeScript, Node.js (Express) and MySQL

I recently graduated from IO Academies Full Stack Track where I worked on both individual and team projects while applying agile methodologies. As part of a scrum team, I actively participate in sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives. We regularly practice peer programming and use Git for version control. My current interests include PHP, Slim and React.

You can check out my work live on my portfolio or GitHub, where you will find some of my favourite projects including a food delivery app, a tip splitter and a backend IT bug tracker. 

Before transitioning into software development, I spent ten years in the Maritime Industry working on superyachts where I progressed from Junior Deckhand to Chief Officer. Along the way, I gained multiple qualifications and developed key skills in leadership, teamwork, discipline and problem-solving, qualities that now shape my approach to collaborating in agile environments and continuous learning.</p>
